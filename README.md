# Drawing_App
A simple android drawing app. I followed a tutorial online to implement the basic functions in this app. Then I added extra functions such as
1. Users can take photo and sketch in the overlay on photo.
2. Users can add text comment on the overlay.
3. Users can select an particular image or photo from the system picture folder or gallery, and then save as a new image.
